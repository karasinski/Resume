## Hi, I'm John!

Thanks for stopping by. I'm a Human Factors researcher with a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering, and I'm passionate about the intersection of human performance and space exploration. My goal is to make space travel safer and more efficient by designing and developing the systems that astronauts interact with every day.

I love the challenge of turning complex technical needs into intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. Feel free to learn more about my work or get in touch:
